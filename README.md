# Unicode Utilities
This repository contains a single C++ header file that contains basic unicode utilities.

This header is used in a number of my projects, including:
- [celestia.io](http://celestia.io/) (closed-source server)
- [Circuit Sandbox](https://github.com/btzy/circuit-sandbox) (open-source sandbox game for circuit simulation)

If you are using this header for your projects, I would appreciate if you tell me about it, so I can list your project on this document.
